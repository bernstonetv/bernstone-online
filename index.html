🌊 Currents System  
The sea is alive, and it changes as you fish! During your journey, you'll encounter dynamic Currents — temporary sea events that can enhance your fishing experience. Currents effects only apply to <span class="cmd">!fish</span>.

These events happen automatically every 30 minutes, or they can be manually summoned by Streamloots Cards.

Use <span class="cmd">!currents</span> to check which events are currently active!

⚡ Types of Sea Currents:
🌩 Stormy Waters  
> Common and Uncommon fish are easier to catch.

🌕 Full Moon  
> Greatly increases the chance of catching Mythic fish.

> Stacks with gear for turbo fishing!

🌪️ Cyclone Eye  
> Chaos on the sea! XP and BernCoins become wildly unpredictable (0.0× to 2.0× multiplier).

🪙 Bounty Frenzy  
> Catching the Bounty Fish during this current grants massive 100× XP and BernCoin rewards!

⏳ Duration:  
> Automatically triggered events last 5 minutes.  
> Manually summoned currents via Streamloots Cards last 30 minutes and extend if already active.

🪝 Rods & Gear

<span class="cmd">!buygear</span> / <span class="cmd">!bg</span>  
→ Spend 0.25 BernCoins to reduce your <span class="cmd">!fish</span> cooldown from 60s to 20s & <span class="cmd">!castnet</span> cooldown from 15m to 5m for 5.5 minutes.  
Can be used again to extend duration.  
Use <span class="cmd">!geartime</span> / <span class="cmd">!gt</span> to check remaining time.

<span class="cmd">!buyrod</span> &lt;rarity&gt; / <span class="cmd">!br</span>  
→ Boost your chance of catching a specific fish rarity for your next 10 <span class="cmd">!fish</span> casts (not <span class="cmd">!castnet</span>).  
Use <span class="cmd">!rodcheck</span> / <span class="cmd">!rc</span> to check your rod and remaining casts.  
Buying the same rod again adds 10 more uses.  
You can only have 1 rod active at a time.

🎣 Rod Costs (BernCoins):  
Rare Rod → 0.10  
Epic Rod → 0.20  
Legendary Rod → 0.35  
Mythic Rod → 0.50

🎯 Rod Effect:  
Increases the chance of catching that rarity.  
Boosted rarity weight = 3×

💱 BernCoin Conversion  
<span class="cmd">!cbc</span> &lt;amount&gt; or <span class="cmd">!cbc all</span>  
→ Convert BernCoins into points at a rate of:  
1 BernCoin = 1% of total system points  
Example: <span class="cmd">!cbc 0.5</span> or <span class="cmd">!cbc all</span>  
⏳ 60-minute cooldown between conversions

🧱 Milestone Rewards  
→ Earn BernCoins by catching enough fish of each rarity — rewards scale infinitely!

🎯 Claiming  
Use <span class="cmd">!claimmilestone</span> &lt;rarity&gt; or <span class="cmd">/cm</span> &lt;rarity&gt; to claim your milestone reward.  
Every claim increases the fish required and the reward.  
Milestones are based on lifetime catches (they don’t reset).

📊 Progress  
Use <span class="cmd">!milestoneprogress</span> or <span class="cmd">/mp</span> to check your current milestone progress across all rarities.  
See how close you are to your next reward.

📈 Examples  
Common:  
Catch 1,000 → +5 BC  
Then 2,000 → +6.25 BC  
Then 4,000 → +7.81 BC  
(keeps scaling...)

Mythic:  
Catch 25 → +30 BC  
Then 50 → +37.5 BC  
Then 100 → +46.88 BC  
(infinite scaling!)

🧠 Notes  
You can claim for every rarity: common → mythic  
Each milestone gets progressively harder and more rewarding  
BernCoins are added directly to your balance

🛥️ Boat System  
→ Automatically fish every few minutes during a fishing event — perfect for AFK or lurking!

💰 Buying a Boat  
Use <span class="cmd">!buyboat</span> mythic, legendary, or epic  
Each boat costs:  
Mythic → 3 BernCoins  
Legendary → 1.0 BernCoin  
Epic → 0.4 BernCoins  
Boat runs for 1.5 hours per purchase  
Buying the same tier again extends the time  
Only one boat active at a time — wait for expiration to change tiers

🕒 How It Works  
Boats auto-cast based on tier:  
Mythic → every 1 minute  
Legendary → every 3 minutes  
Epic → every 5 minutes  
Earn XP and BernCoins on every cast  
Fully automatic once launched — no input needed

🌊 Boats Are Affected By:  
✔️ Double XP → More XP per catch  
✔️ School of Fish → Multiplies fish count  
✔️ Full Moon → Rare chance for Mythic fish  
✔️ Stormy Waters → Boosts Common & Uncommon fish  
✔️ Cyclone → Makes XP and BernCoins wild and unpredictable

🚫 Boats Are NOT Affected By:  
❌ Red Moon → No unique fish from boats  
❌ Rushing Current → Boats do not fish faster  
❌ Golden Tide → No BernCoin boost  
❌ Bounty system → Only manual fishing can hit bounty rewards

🛠️ Extra Notes  
Boats do not use bait or rods  
No unique fish can be caught by boats  
Boat expires automatically after 1.5 hours (or after time extension)  
Use <span class="cmd">!boattime</span> or <span class="cmd">!bt</span> to check how much time your boat has left

🎯 Hidden Reel Fish  
<span class="cmd">!reel</span> (number) → Guess the hidden number (1–30) to catch a mysterious fish.

🕵️ How it works:  
• A fish with a secret number spawns every 15–30 minutes.  
• Anyone can guess the number.  
• First correct guess catches it.  
• Cooldown: 15s per person.  
• Fish despawns after 5 minutes if not caught.  
• Rewards: 100× XP + 10× BernCoins based on fish rarity.  
• ✨ Rarer fish give higher rewards.  
• 🐟 Anyone watching can participate!
